# e-commerce
A key challenge for e-commerce businesses is to analyze the trend in the market to increase their sales. The trend can be easily observed if the companies can group the customers; based on their activity on the e-commerce site. This grouping can be done by applying different criteria like previous orders, mostly searched brands and so on. The machine learning clustering algorithms can provide an analytical method to cluster customers with similar interests.
